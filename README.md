# 📊 Quality Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

> A Data-Driven Dashboard to Monitor and Improve Operational Quality Metrics

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Quality Analysis Dashboard** provides a comprehensive view of operational performance using key quality metrics such as **defect rates**, **error percentages**, and **quality scores** across various departments, managers, employees, and geographic locations. The aim is to **identify quality trends**, **highlight areas for improvement**, and **enhance decision-making** through rich data visualization in **Power BI**.

Auditing and assessing task quality across departments (Sales, Finance, Backoffice) by tracking errors, defects, and performance metrics over time, by location, and by individuals (employees, managers, and auditors).
